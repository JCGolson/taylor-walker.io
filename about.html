                <h1>About Taylor-Walker Actuaries</h1>
                <hr class="style1">

                <p><b>Taylor-Walker Consulting, LLC</b> has been in business since the mid 1980's.</p>

                <p>First known as Walker & Associates and founded by Merle LaMar Walker II, ASA, MAAA, our firm
                    concentrated primarily on regulation services to state insurance departments. For several years we
                    also employed financial and market conduct examiners. As such, we gained valuable experience in the
                    governing and regulation of state insurance departments with regard to insurance companies, as well
                    as gaining a rapport with state officials. </p>

                <p>In 1993 the firm was purchased by Mr. R. Glenn Taylor, ACAS, MAAA, one of our partners, and the name was changed to Taylor-Walker & Associates, Inc. At that time Taylor-Walker became an actuarial-only firm. However, our actuaries still continued to support the states in performing the actuarial portion of state examinations. </p>

                <p>During the early 1990's under Mr. Taylor's leadership, we became knowledgeable in other areas,
                    especially in providing services to the captive insurance industry. Working both with the captive
                    companies themselves, and state captive insurance personnel, we became one of the first actuarial
                    firms to assist in the formation and regulation of captive insurance companies. </p>

                <p>We continued to grow, and after 23 years under Mr. Taylor, he stepped down as President, and the
                    business was purchased by Mr. Scott Garduno, FSA, MAAA, an actuary with the firm since 2006. All Taylor-Walker & Associates employees (and many original Walker & Associates employees) continue to work for Taylor-Walker Consulting, LLC.  Over the years additional qualified personnel have joined our firm.</p>

                <p>We are committed to all of our client's needs, and continue to provide the same great service that we
                    have been providing since inception to regulatory, captive, self-funded, and insurance companies.
                </p>
